# Documentation

What you are seeing now is a sphinx documentation.

It references the actual source code and docstrings in there
and compiles all of it to html.

The docs website is updated **on push to the dev branch**

It might take a while until you see the update so its useful to know how get
the documentation build locally.

## Dependencies

So first of all you will need to install needed packages to compile the docs.
Navigate to `docs` directory and run:

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	
if you have some path issues with your python it is also worth to try:
	
	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
	
## Understanding docs

Now let's understand how our documentation works. Here is what you will find in the `docs` directory.

	.
	├── make.bat
	├── Makefile
	├── requirements.txt
	└── source
		├── conf.py
		├── development.md
		├── getting-started.md
		├── index.rst
		├── _static
		└── _templates
		
- `make.bat` and `Makefile` are there to compile our documentation to html

- `requirements.txt` is what you just used to install our requirements.

- `source/` directory where the source files for our documentation are located. You will find a bunch
  of `.md` and `.rst` files there. These are pages with the actual text and tutorials that you see just now
  (this webpage is made from `development.md`, and the landing page is `index.rst`)
  
all `.md` files must be referenced in `index.rst` files. You can do it like so:

	.. toctree::
	   :maxdepth: 1
	   :caption: Development

	   development

This creates a table of content entry at the side bar on the landing page
with a caption **Development** and references the file `development.md`
(no need to add file extension in rst files as it doesn't care)

## Compilation

So now that you have made changes to the actual documentation,
in order to compile it, navigate to the `docs` directory and run:

	make clean; make html
	
This will create a build folder where you can find all html files.
