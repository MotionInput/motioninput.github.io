# Configuration
Settings that are unique to each users can be configured by editing the four JSON files located in the data directory. For the time being these settings can only be changed manually, however the aim is to be able to update them during runtime. The four JSON files are responsible for holding information about:
* [Gestures](https://motioninput.github.io/configuration.html#gestures)
* [Events](https://motioninput.github.io/configuration.html#events)
* [Modes](https://motioninput.github.io/configuration.html#modes)
* [General Settings](https://motioninput.github.io/configuration.html#config)

Developers can read values from these JSON files using the JSONEditor classes.

## Gestures

Gestures are composed of primitives which are either activated or deactivated, represented by a boolean value.

The gestures are split between the separate modules:

* hand
* body
* head
* eye
* speech

A gesture will be of the form:

```
"gesture_name": {
	"primitive_1": bool,
	"primitive_2": bool,
	"primitive_3": bool,
	...
}
```
## Events

The events are mappings of [GestureEvent](https://motioninput.github.io/apidocs/scripts.gesture_events.html) classes to [event handlers](https://motioninput.github.io/apidocs/scripts.gesture_event_handlers.html) method(s).

The GestureEvent class ("type") determines under what conditions and when will the handler methods ("triggers") be called. These conditions can be modified by the "args" if the conditions are event instance-specific or by elements in the config file if those conditions are event class-specific.

The "bodypart_names_to_type" determines what detected body parts (aka trackers in the modules like "Left"(hand), "Right"(hand) or "head") will be used by the event instances. This is mostly used to determine the hand used in hand gestures.

The "triggers" are pairs of handler classes and its methods that we want to be called when the event calls its trigger functions.
All available methods are well visible in the \_\_init\_\_.py in gesture_event_handlers

An event will be of the form:

```
"event_name": {
	"type": "GestureEvent_class_name",
	"args": {
		"arg_1": val,
		"arg_2": val,
		...
	},
	"bodypart_names_to_type": {
		"modules_tracker_name_1": "events_bodypart_name",
		...
	},
	"triggers": {
		"trigger_1_name": ["GestureEventHandler_class_name","method_name"],
		"trigger_2_name": ["GestureEventHandler_class_name","method_name"],
		...
	}
}
```

## Modes

The modes determine the sets of [events](https://motioninput.github.io/configuration.html#events) that are available to the user at any one time. When the MI starts the events from the "default" mode are loaded into the model and then afterwards the user can switch between modes in one of the following ways:

1. By having an event with the "trigger" ["ModeChange","mode_name"]. This handler sets the mode to whatever mode name is specified.
2.  By having an event with the "trigger" ["IterativeModeChange",""]. This handler sets the mode to whichever one follows the current order specified in the "iteration_order".
3. If using the GUI then it will be possible to request the mode change through the protocol.

The "iteration_order" should contain every mode name that is listed in the "modes" with another mode name from there. Ideally, the iteration orders should make one or multiple closed loops (possibly of size 1 if changing from that mode does not make sense) meaning it should be possible to get back to the mode where the user started.

The JSON file has the following format:

```
"default": "mode_name",
"iteration_order": {
	"mode_name_1": "mode_name_2",
	"mode_name_2": "mode_name_1",
	"mode_name_3": "mode_name_3",
	...
	},
"modes": {
	"mode_name_1":[
